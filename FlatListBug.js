This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with a large dataset. The error message might vary, but it typically indicates that the list is trying to render more items than allowed or available, causing performance issues and crashes. It often appears as a `VirtualizedList` warning or an out-of-memory error.

```javascript
//Example of code that might cause the error
<FlatList
  data={largeDataset} // largeDataset is a very large array
  renderItem={({item}) => <ItemComponent item={item}/>}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
/>
```
